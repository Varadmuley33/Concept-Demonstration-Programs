# Datatype Folder – C Programming

## Overview

This folder contains concise **C programs focused on demonstrating datatype behaviour** and memory representation. Each program is created to explain how datatypes work internally rather than to solve complex problems.

---

## Purpose

* Strengthen understanding of C datatypes
* Visualise memory usage and size behaviour
* Explain modifiers and qualifiers in action
* Provide quick reference for datatype concepts

---

## Concepts Included

* Basic datatypes and memory size
* sizeof operator usage
* Signed and unsigned behaviour
* short and long modifiers
* const qualifier behaviour
* Datatypes with pointers and addresses

Programs follow a clear A-to-Z learning sequence.

---

## How to Use

1. Open any program file
2. Read the brief header description
3. Run the code and observe output
4. Relate the output to datatype behaviour

---

## Standards

* Clean and structured code
* Professional headers
* CamelCase filenames
* One concept per program

---

## Note

This folder is built to make datatype concepts simple, practical, and easy to remember. It acts as a solid base before moving to advanced C programming topics.
