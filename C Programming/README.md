# C Programming – Concept Demonstration Programs

## 📘 Overview

This folder contains a structured collection of **C programming concept demonstration programs** created to explain core fundamentals of the C language in a clear, practical, and easy-to-understand manner.

Each program focuses on showcasing a specific concept rather than solving complex problems. The goal is to build strong foundational understanding by observing how each concept behaves in real execution.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Folder

The primary objectives of this C folder are:

* To demonstrate fundamental C programming concepts
* To provide clarity on how core features work internally
* To serve as a reference for learning and revision
* To prepare a strong base before moving to logical problem solving

Every program is designed to highlight one concept with professional documentation and structured formatting.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

This folder demonstrates a wide range of C programming concepts, including but not limited to:

* Basic program structure and syntax
* Data types and their memory representation
* Type modifiers and qualifiers
* Operators and expressions behaviour
* Arrays and their internal working
* Pointer fundamentals and address manipulation
* Memory layout and size understanding
* Increment and decrement operations
* Constant variables and compiler-level restrictions
* Array-pointer relationships

The focus is on understanding **how and why** these concepts behave the way they do.
