# Pointer Folder – C Programming

## Overview

This folder contains **C programs demonstrating pointer concepts** in a clear and practical way. Each program is designed to show how pointers store addresses, access data, and interact with memory.

---

## Purpose

* Understand pointer fundamentals
* Visualise memory addressing
* Learn pointer operations and behaviour
* Strengthen base for advanced memory concepts

---

## Concepts Included

* Pointer declaration and initialization
* Address storage and dereferencing
* Multiple level pointers
* Pointer arithmetic
* Pointer with arrays
* Difference between pointer operations

Programs follow a step-by-step progression for easy understanding.

---

## How to Use

1. Open a pointer program file
2. Read the header description
3. Run the program
4. Observe how pointers access memory

---

## Standards

* Structured professional headers
* CamelCase file naming
* Clean and readable code
* One pointer concept per program
