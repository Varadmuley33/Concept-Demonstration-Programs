# Array Folder – C Programming

## Overview

This folder contains **C programs that demonstrate array concepts** clearly and practically. Each program focuses on understanding how arrays work internally, how memory is allocated, and how elements are accessed and manipulated.

---

## Purpose

* Build strong understanding of arrays in C
* Visualise memory layout of arrays
* Understand indexing and element access
* Explain array-pointer relationship
* Provide quick reference for array behaviour

---

## Concepts Included

* Array initialization techniques
* Accessing elements using index
* Size calculation using sizeof
* Base address and address of elements
* Pointer arithmetic with arrays
* Array and pointer relationship
* Constant nature of array name

Programs follow a logical learning sequence for smooth concept building.

---

## How to Use

1. Select any array program file
2. Read the header description
3. Execute the code
4. Observe how array behaves in memory

---

## Standards

* Clean and structured code
* Professional documentation style
* CamelCase file naming
* One array concept per program

---

## Note

This folder is designed to make array concepts simple, visual, and easy to understand. It strengthens the foundation required for mastering pointers, strings, and advanced data structures in C.
